Recommendation G.9963 is a home networking standard under development at the International Telecommunication Union standards sector, the ITU-T.
It was begun in 2010 by ITU-T to add multiple-input and multiple-output (known as MIMO) capabilities to the G.hn standard originally defined in Recommendation G.9960. The standard is also known as "G.hn-mimo".
As part of the family of G.hn standards, G.9963 was endorsed by the HomeGrid Forum.
