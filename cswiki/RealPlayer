RealPlayer, by RealNetworks, is a cross-platform software product primarily used for the playing of recorded media. The media player is compatible with numerous formats within the multimedia realm, including MP3, MPEG-4, QuickTime, Windows Media, and multiple versions (proprietary) of RealAudio and RealVideo formats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.real.com/product/help/r1p_v2g/en/MM_Media_Formats.htm |title=Supported Formats by RealOne Player |publisher=Home.real.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611210214/http://home.real.com/product/help/r1p_v2g/en/MM_Media_Formats.htm |archivedate = June 11, 2008[/tpl] RealPlayer is also available for other operating systems (OS) and Linux, Unix, Palm OS, Windows Mobile and Symbian versions have been released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realnetworks.com/products/media_players.html |title=RealPlayer - Multiple Editions |publisher=Realnetworks.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl] 
The software is powered by an underlying open source media engine called Helix.[tpl]cite web|url=https://helixcommunity.org/beula/ |title=Helix Community License |publisher=Helixcommunity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl] The latest current stable release is version RealPlayer SP 1.0. 

==History==

The first version of RealPlayer was introduced in April 1995 as "RealAudio Player" and was one of the first media players capable of streaming media over the Internet. Then, version 4.01 of RealPlayer was included as a selectable Internet tool in Windows 98's installation package.[tpl]cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/scripts/sysadmin/answerfile_w98.htm |title=msbatch.inf - Unattended and Customized Installation of Windows 98 |accessdate=2010-02-03[/tpl] Subsequent versions of the software were titled "RealPlayer G2" (version 6) and "RealOne Player" (version 9), whilst free "Basic" versions as well as paid "Plus" versions, the latter with additional features, have also been offered. For the Windows OS, the RealPlayer version 9 subsumed the features of the separate program, RealJukebox.
RealPlayer 11 was released for Microsoft Windows in November 2007 and for Mac OS X in May 2008. RealPlayer 15 was released November 18, 2011. This version allows users to transfer video, music and photos between their computers and mobile devices, share links of videos and photos on sites such as Facebook and MySpace, and download videos from popular sites such as YouTube and Metacafe.
RealPlayer was a popular streaming media player during the early years of the Internet, but, as of the 21st century, its market share has been surpassed by Windows Media Player and, since mid-2007, by Apple's iTunes.[tpl]cite web|author=By website optimization on 18 Jan 2008 AM |url=http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0801/ |title=iTunes Passes RealPlayer in Unique Users |publisher=Websiteoptimization.com |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl] RealPlayer was initially accessed by many users as a plugin to watch streaming video or listen to streaming audio (most of the BBC's websites formerly employed the plugin);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/help/faq/download_and_install_realplayer.shtml |title=How do I download and install RealPlayer?|publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-14[/tpl] but, again in the 21st century, Adobe Flash has become the preferred option for this purpose (demonstrated by the comparable success of the BBC iPlayer). The number of unique users using RealPlayer has fallen by 50% over the three-year period from March 2007 to March 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/1003/|title=Apple Bites into Microsoft's Streaming Media Lead - US Broadband Penetration Grows to 95.3% Among Active Internet Users - March 2010 Bandwidth Report|publisher=BBC|date=|accessdate=2010-06-04[/tpl]

Their Web page regarding PalmOS support (shown above) gives no indication if support for those devices will ever be provided.

===RealJukebox===

RealJukebox was a computer program released by RealNetworks that allowed users to organise their digital music. It was first released in May 1999. By late 2001 the functions of the program had been integrated into the Real's core media player program, RealPlayer.

==Controversies==

Past versions of RealPlayer have been criticized for containing adware and spyware. In 1999 security researcher Richard M. Smith dissected some of RealJukebox's network traffic and discovered that it was sending a unique identifier with information about the music titles to which its users were listening.  RealNetworks issued a patch, and the spyware was removed in version 1.02. Their download page stated RealJukebox included privacy enhancements and gave a link to the privacy policy.
PC World magazine named RealPlayer (1999 Version) as #2 in its 2006 list The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time, writing that RealPlayer "had a disturbing way of making itself a little too much at home on your PC--installing itself as the default media player, taking liberties with your Windows Registry, popping up annoying 'messages' that were really just advertisements, and so on."  In 2007, it placed RealPlayer, versions 1996-2004, at #5 in its list, The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130638-page,2-c,techindustrytrends/article.html | title = The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products | first = Dan | last = Tynan | date = 2007-04-16 | accessdate = 2007-04-17 | publisher = PC World[/tpl]
In 2008 StopBadware.org labeled RealPlayer "badware" for not completely disclosing software components it installs as well as those it leaves behind after being un-installed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=realplayer01282008 |title=StopBadware Report: Realplayer |publisher=StopBadware.org |date=2008-01-28  |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl] Jeff Chasen, vice president for RealPlayer, responded by stating: "I actually admire what StopBadware is trying to do to keep consumers safe.  But in this case the only thing bad is the report itself.  Here’s why: Not a single claim raised by StopBadware actually hurts anyone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://rws-blog.rhapsody.com/realplayer/2008/02/reals-response.html |title=Real’s Response to StopBadware.org blog entry| publisher=Rws-blog.rhapsody.com |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2009-07-16 |archivedate=2008-02-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080227180404/http://rws-blog.rhapsody.com/realplayer/2008/02/reals-response.html[/tpl]
The RealPlayer Message Center has caused controversy due to its pop-up advertisements. In previous versions of the program the Message Center had a reputation for being difficult to turn off completely. In RealPlayer 11 it will not appear unless it is turned on by the user.
When RealPlayer for Windows is installed, a process called tkbell.exe will run automatically each time the computer starts up, and may appear on the list of active processes as realsched.exe.  The process is linked to the Message Center and can also check for updates to the program.  The process is non-essential and is not considered to be harmful, but has been seen as a nuisance by some users.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auditmypc.com/process/tkbell.asp |first=James |last=Maurer |title=What is tkbell.exe? |publisher=Auditmypc.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl]  It can be disabled by altering the settings of RealPlayer's Message Center.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.help2go.com/Tutorials/MP3%10Audio/Disable_RealPlayer_realsched.exe.html |title=Disable RealPlayer realsched.exe |publisher=Help2Go|first= Oscar|last= Sodani |date=2004-07-07 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060111184746/http://www.help2go.com/Tutorials/MP3%10Audio/Disable_RealPlayer_realsched.exe.html |archivedate=2006-01-11 |accessdate=2010-08-17[/tpl]
Earlier Windows versions of RealPlayer experienced a problem with the volume control, where muting the sound in the program would also mute all system sounds.[tpl]cite web|author=User Telstar|url=http://forums.techguy.org/multimedia/384746-adjusting-realplayer-volume-affects-comp.html |title=Adjusting RealPlayer volume affects Comp volume settings |publisher=Forums.techguy.org |date=2005-07-26 |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl]
