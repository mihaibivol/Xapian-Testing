==History==

Spotify has been developed since 2006 by a team at Spotify AB, Stockholm, Sweden. The company was founded there by Daniel Ek, former CTO of Stardoll, and Martin Lorentzon, co-founder of TradeDoubler. The parent company is now Spotify Ltd in London,[tpl]cite web|author=Spotify Limited Edit details |url=http://www.duedil.com/company/06436047/spotify-limited |title=Spotify Limited in London - Free Companies House Name Check on Spotify Limited |publisher=Duedil |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl] while research and development remains carried out by Spotify AB in Stockholm.
The Spotify application was launched for public access on 7 October 2008. While free accounts still remained available by invitation only in order to manage the growth rate of the service, the launch meant that paid subscriptions were opened to everyone. At the same time, Spotify AB also announced licensing deals with many major music labels.We've only just begun! Spotify AB blog. 7 October 2008.

===Playlists===

Users can set up playlists and share them,ShareMyPlaylist, a popular playlist sharing service. http://sharemyplaylists.com. April 2010. or edit them together with other users (see collaborative software). For this purpose the playlist link can directly be dragged into an email or an instant messaging window. If the recipient follows the link, the playlist will be downloaded into the Spotify-client of the recipient. Downloaded playlists will then auto-update if the author adds or removes tracks. Like normal links, the playlist links can be used everywhere. The same principle also works for single tracks, which can be used via drag and drop on applications and websites at will.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spotify.com/en/help/faq/#share-music |title=FAQ: Share music |publisher=Spotify |date= |accessdate=3 February 2009[/tpl] There are a number of websites for sharing of Spotify playlists and songs where users can share, rate and discuss them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spotify.com/blog/archives/2009/01/16/sharing-is-good-share-your-spotify-playlists/ |title=Blog: Sharing is good, share your spotify playlists |publisher=Spotify |date= |accessdate=16 February 2009[/tpl]

===Last.fm integration===

While Spotify does not automatically create preference-based playlists, it does integrate with Last.fm. This integration allows Spotify users to send songs from Spotify to their Last.fm account and "scrobble" them. Scrobbling via Last.fm integration allows Spotify users to learn which songs or artists they listen to the most. In turn, Spotify users can add a Spotify link to songs in their Last.fm library and send them to the Spotify client.[tpl]cite web|url=http://money.msn.com/shopping-deals/article.aspx?post=0a669943-3a45-4938-97e8-b299353121d4 |title=Spotify: The future of music is here- MSN Money |publisher=Money.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl]

===Radio===

Spotify also includes a Radio feature available to Spotify Free, Unlimited and Premium accounts, which creates a random playlist of songs chosen based on specified genres and decades. An Artist Radio feature creates a random playlist of songs by artists related to (and including) the selected artist.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/5082273/Spotify-to-start-selling-music-downloads.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Spotify to start selling music downloads | date=31 March 2009[/tpl]  Artist Radio channels on Spotify provide background information on the selected artist, ranging from its history to a list of the artist's most famous singles. The Spotify radio function demonstrates distinct differences from its competitor, Pandora. With the Spotify radio function, users are allowed to skip as many tracks as desired, while Pandora places limits on the number of tracks that can be skipped. Additionally, Spotify does not allow users to lend "star ratings" to tracks, thus, limiting the ability to organize the radio function based on user preference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/news/spotify-rolls-out-artist-radio-feature-its-nice-but-its-no-pandora-20110728/ |title=Spotify rolls out Artist Radio feature: It's nice, but it's no Pandora – Tech Products & Geek News |publisher=Geek.com |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl]

Once a user integrates their Spotify account with other social media profiles, they are able to access their friends' favorite music and or playlists.http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/52305191-80/spotify-music-songs-service.html.csp  Additionally, Facebook compatibility allows Spotify users to share music with Facebook friends through the use of the service's inbox.

==Technical information==

The Spotify software is proprietary and uses digital rights management (DRM) to prevent unauthorized use of content. Users who agree to Spotify's Terms and Conditions agree to not reverse engineer the application.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/end-user-agreement/plain/|title=Spotify® Terms and Conditions of Use[/tpl] This has been criticised as "defective by design" by Defective by Design, a Free Software Foundation campaign[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/spotify |title=Spotify is Defective by Design |date=18 August 2011[/tpl]
The contents of each client's cache is summarized in an index which is sent to the Spotify stream hub upon connecting to the service. This index is then used to inform other clients about additional peers they can connect to for fetching streamed data for individual tracks being played. This is accommodated by each client, upon startup, acting as a server listening for incoming connections from other Spotify users, as well as connecting to other users to exchange cached data as appropriate. There are currently no official details from the developers about how many connections and how much of a user's upstream bandwidth the Spotify client will use when streaming to other users; the Spotify client offers no way for the user to configure this.
Audio streams are in the Vorbis format at q5 (approx. 160 kbit/s),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spotify.com/en/help/faq/|title=Spotify FAQ|publisher=Spotify |accessdate=16 March 2009[/tpl] or optional q9 (approx. 320kbit/s)[tpl]cite web|last=Sehr |first=Andres |url=http://www.spotify.com/blog/archives/2009/06/25/bumping-up-the-bitrate/ |title=Bumping up the bitrate |publisher=Spotify |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl] for Premium subscribers. Spotify boasts having an almost buffer-free streaming service.
As of version 0.4.3, it is possible to also play back local MP3 and AAC files, though this does not work in Linux using Wine because Spotify is "... blocking codecs with the identifier "WINE-MPEG3″ until the Wine system works satisfactorily."Spotify under Wine. Spotify.com help pages. However, the native Linux version supports local files.
Cache size and location is configurable. 1 GB or more disk space is recommended.[tpl]citation[/tpl] On Mac OS X, a G4 processor or higher is required. A user must set up an account in order to use the software. This account can be used on several computers, but music playback is limited to one computer at a time.
Spotify uses peer to peer transfers to supplement their available bandwidth. This has led to it being banned on large networks where users are not responsible for bandwidth costs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7019157/Oxford-University-bans-students-from-Spotify.html|title=Oxford University bans students from Spotify|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=3 March 2012[/tpl]

==Revenue model==

Spotify is funded by paid subscriptions, advertisements in the Spotify player for non-subscribers and music purchases from partner retailers. It offers a US$10 per month unlimited subscription, close to the Open Music Model (OMM) estimated economic equilibrium for the recording industry. However, the incorporation of DRM diverges from the OMM, as well as from competitors such as iTunes and Amazon MP3, which have dropped DRM.
In February 2009, the advertisements for non-paying users were reported as lasting 15 secondsMcCormick, Neil (24 February 2009). Make way for Spotify: a big digital jukebox in the ether. The Daily Telegraph. though in May 2009, Neowin reported that the approximate length has increased to 30 seconds.Harrison, Elliot (2 May 2009). Spotify review: The iTunes killer? Neown.net.

On 2 December 2009, Spotify launched "Premium ecards" (premium codes), which upgrade an account to "Premium" status for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months.Spotify e-cards announced Spotify blog, 2 December 2009

=== Royalties ===

The service has come under fire for failing to compensate independent artists fairly.

In September 2011, Brooklyn-based independent label Projekt Records entered a public disagreement with Spotify, stating "In the world I want to live in, I envision artists fairly compensated for their creations, because we (the audience) believe in the value of what artists create.

Spotify's artist-in-residence responded to the criticism by stating that 70% of Spotify's revenue is paid out in royalties, and that the per-stream royalty rate doubled between the service's inception and mid-2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120622/16193319442/myth-dispensing-whole-spotify-barely-pays-artists-story-is-bunk.shtml |title=Myth Dispensing: The Whole 'Spotify Barely Pays Artists' Story Is Bunk |publisher=Techdirt |date=2012-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl] Charles Caldas, CEO of the Merlin Network for independent artists, argues that the problem isn't Spotify's failure to pay out significant royalties, but that it's paid to the record labels, who then pass too little of it onto their artists.

===Third-party clients and libraries===

A number of third-party (and open source) projects have developed software to access Spotify services. The most prominent of these is Despotify, originally released as a ncurses text-mode client for Linux and Mac OS X. All third-party applications and development libraries require a Spotify premium subscription to work.
* Despotify: http://despotify.se/
* Jotify: a Java client.

====Despotify====

Despotify is a free software client for Spotify. Its authors remain anonymous, but write on their website that they are a group of Swedish computer science researchers and security professionals who "believe strongly in the right to tinker with technology".
The software can be run on most mainstream POSIX-compliant operating systems for which there is an ANSI C compiler. It also requires one of Core Audio, GStreamer, libao or PulseAudio to be installed. There is also a Despotify-based client, Spot, for jailbroken iPhones.
Spotify has blocked usage of Despotify for "Free" and "Open" accounts, but those with a "Premium" account can use Despotify if they wish. The Despotify team have said that they would not attempt to circumvent the block. The code may however be forked by others to attempt to do this."Update regarding the usage of 'free' or 'daypass' accounts". Despotify. 26 February 2009.
The Despotify library has language bindings for Python and Ruby. It depends on the OpenSSL, zlib and libvorbis libraries.
